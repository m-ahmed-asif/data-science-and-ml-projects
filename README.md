## 🔍 Overview

This repository contains five end-to-end data science and machine learning projects completed during my internship at **DevelopersHub Corporation**. These projects demonstrate skills in data preprocessing, visualization, machine learning modeling, evaluation, and deriving business insights using tools like **Python, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, and scikit-learn**.

Each project is structured with:
- Problem definition  
- Dataset exploration  
- EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)  
- Model training & testing  
- Performance evaluation  
- Key insights
